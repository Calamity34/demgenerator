# demgenerator

everybody knows what a demotivator is, the thing is that this script creates them from a source image and text using the terminal.

---
## usage examples

the script should output the `output.png` to the folder with the script (for now, will fix later).  
that means the script **must be** ran from the folder where it is located.

__examples:__

- `python script.py image.png "honestly very"` - generates an image using "honestly very" as the top text  
- `python script.py image.png "honestly very" incredible` - generates an image using "honestly very" as the top text and "incredible" as the bottom text  
- `python script.py D:/otherimage.png very pog` - generates an image using the file from a path, "very" as the top text, and "pog" as the bottom text

## things

i just got the script together in like 20 minutes at night, so sorry for any errors that might happen for now.
